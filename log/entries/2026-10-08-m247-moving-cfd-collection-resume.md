Archive moving-cfd-pilot-20261008-172613 confirms native build and all40 steps
completed180-180.2us in384.4038s. Wrapper failure is MW05: missing thermal
metadata in the Python collector, not a solver failure. Original fvSolution
explicitly sets epsilonTolerance1e-5 and phaseTemperatureTolerance0.001K.
Complete collection against the actual diagnostic fixture passes all pilot screens:
no thermal limit hits; wakeMissed0; maximum thermal mapping proxy relative drift
7.383e-14; maximum divL1=0.019312/s. This is not production approval.

After pulling feat/m247-material-port, run:
```bash
./tests/m247Performance/RunMovingCFDPilot --resume
```
Default input is runs/moving-cfd-pilot-20261008-172613. The original run directory,
original automatic review archive and hash-checked original coarse source must
remain available. Resume verifies archived critical input hashes, reads explicit
thermal controls, copies small review inputs into a fresh collection directory,
and does not build/decompose/advance CFD. Send its automatically named
M247_moving-cfd-collection-<timestamp>_review.tar.gz. Never overwrite old evidence.

127Python tests pass, including complete actual40-step collection and end-to-end
read-only resume/package regression; Bash syntax passes. Ubuntu recollection is
pending. Future runs write required tolerances before launching CFD.

Cost remains1922s/us under conservative5ns maximum steps, with40 mesh changes.
Timing shares: thermal32.54%, alpha30.95% (includes mesh update and VOF), laser23.19%,
pressure8.69%. These are not a matched speedup comparison. Next acceleration work
must separately measure mesh-update cost and evaluate amortized refinement with
protected wake/window coverage before equivalent-physics comparisons. No24h
4um or full-track feasibility claim is justified by this short pilot.

Implemented m247MixtureEnthalpy and m247RegionalState: separate energy density,
metal volume fraction and latent-energy inventory; reconstruct T at fixed phase
inventory. Native regional audit has optional mixtureAudit branch, reads T,
alpha.metal and epsilon1 from thermalRegion, predicts conduction, gathers state,
returns only local delta energy and checks global ledger. Default solver untouched.

Actual material coefficients: rhoMetal7950,rhoGas1,cpGas520,latentGas1;
metal cp790/860,Ts1537,Tl1631,latent150000. Uses solver alpha-weighted cp and
legacy alpha_filtered latent thresholds (<.01,>.99). h reference0K is explicit.
This diagnostic closure does NOT establish advective TEqn equivalence; mapped
states remain nonequilibrium until local phase equations reconcile them.

Error prevented: averaging energy or temperature while recomputing equilibrium
liquid fraction loses phase inventory. Map latent ENERGY density independently;
alpha averaging may reduce its capacity. Such inadmissible states stop with a
specific error, not clipping. Conservative bounded inventory redistribution is
still required before production motion across such interfaces.

155 Python tests pass. Native C++ build/MPI still unverified in this Windows
environment. No local VOF/pressure/laser solve yet; no speedup or production claim.
Next: conservative admissibility handling, local flow/pressure boundary and source
ownership; build one integrated acceptance driver. No new Ubuntu micro-screen.

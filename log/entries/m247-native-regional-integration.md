
## Native regional stage: transfer/enthalpy/FV wiring implemented, LPBF coupling pending

Added src/m247RegionalCoupling/m247RegionalTransfer.H:owned MPI geometry/data
exchange,sparse rectangular overlap,cache invalidation,integrated correction ledger.
Added pure-metal exactclamped cp/latent enthalpy and inversion,checked with actual
M247790/860cp,150kJ/kg latent parameters in independent Python analytic tests.
Added two-region FV conduction/correction wiring utility with explicitdiffusion guard;
no sourcefield writes.150Python tests pass. Native compilation/MPI runtime unverified.
This is not yet local CFD:mixtureenthalpy,pressure/VOF/laser subdomain boundary,
moving field migration and matched physical/cost acceptance remain outstanding.
No new user-run small test in this checkpoint; preserve old validated solver.
Next development connects region ownership and actual local equations before one
combined user acceptance command. See src/m247RegionalCoupling/README.md.

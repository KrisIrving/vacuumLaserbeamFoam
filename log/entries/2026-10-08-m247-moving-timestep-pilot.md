Native compile/run and all pilot gates pass.40 steps in380.398s job wall;
loop378.642s. Mesh update rank-max sum59.66194s (15.76% loop), native topology
52.41626s, preparation7.17092s. Stage rank maxima are not additive. Thermal35.36%,
laser22.13%, enclosing alpha29.31%. No justified speedup claim versus prior runs.
Even eliminating measured mesh update alone would ideally yield only1.187x,
ignoring effects on other work; cannot meet the full-track goal alone.

Next bounded experiment after pull:
```bash
./tests/m247Performance/RunMovingCFDPilot --dt10
```
Writes runs/moving-cfd-dt10-<timestamp> and automatically packages
M247_moving-cfd-dt10-<timestamp>_review.tar.gz. Same0.2us, same protected initial
state/physics/48 ranks, startup1ns, maxCo/maxAlphaCo0.1 and full thermal/coverage/
mapping/continuity gates; only maximum timestep changes5ns to10ns. Adaptive CFL
may still keep actual steps below10ns. Default invocation retains5ns; resume is
unchanged.15minute solver budget remains. New-run metadata recordsmax_delta_ns.
This is timestep sensitivity screening, not a matched equivalence or production
approval. Review end states/physical diagnostics against180928 and, if needed,
full spatial fields before accepting larger steps.129 local Python tests pass;
Ubuntu10ns run pending. No native C++ change in this update.
